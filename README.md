- 👋 Hi, I’m @ambahjones or Amber Jones. My user name matches up with a lot of my other online accounts or portfolios so I chose it for consistancy.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a web developer in the short term and expanding my knowledge to back end and mobile development as I work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about JavaScript and working my way through the full stack course on Codecademy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me learn more!
- 📫 How to reach me: website coming soon
